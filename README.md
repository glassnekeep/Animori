# Animori
### This Android application is my project for project practice in MEPHI (2nd year). 
---
### Main features of the application
* The user will be able to find out various information about an anime series (title) or a movie. 
* The user can add a title to "Favorites" and select the status ("viewed", "in progress: series #x", "abandoned", "planned", etc.) 
* The main screen will show the user the most popular titles. If the user wants to find an anime to watch, he/she can check the full list of them (the app uses an Anilist public API for getting data) and sort them by genre, number of episodes, rating, year of release, characters and other parameters. 
* The title screen will provide detailed information about the title and show related anime series, films or manga.
